# AI-Decision-Tree
This Project includes data from Seoul’s bike sharing scheme, and in it you will use
a decision tree to predict if it is going to be a busy hour on Seoul’s bicycle lane (if
there are more than 650 bicycle rentals that hour).
I built decision tree from scratch using Chi-square pruning and K-fold Cross-Validation.
